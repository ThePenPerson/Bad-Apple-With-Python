# Bad-Apple-With-Python
A simple (but badly coded) console programme that displays the Bad Apple video as text.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to use:

1. Download the files and put them all into one folder

2. Run the badapple.py application with the console

3. It may then work (hopefully!)

4. If you have any problems or questions comment
